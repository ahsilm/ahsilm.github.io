        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Lisha Maharjan, a Computer Science graduate student at Miami University. I am originally from Kathmandu,
          Nepal. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Nepal. I have a comprehensive knowledge
          and understanding of computer science concepts. I'm particularly interested in the power of data to shape the
          future and committed to leveraging my skills in the data science and software engineering industry. I am
          motivated to learn and grow from experiences and open to exploring new things. My hobbies include travelling,
          music and watching movies.</p>

      <div class="research-card">
        <p>Currently, my research topic is focused around exploring the potential of large language models like ChatGPT
          in producing web accessibility code. This study aims to analyze the accuracy and compliance of the generated
          code with web accessibility standards, and its proficiency in addressing related challenges. Through this
          research, I aspire to
          contribute to the development of more inclusive and accessible web technologies.</p>
